mapnik (0.5~svn638-1) experimental; urgency=low

    This Debian revision of mapnik moves the input plugins from their default
    location in /usr/lib/mapnik/input to /usr/lib/mapnik/0.5/input, to allow
    multiple library versions to coexist on one system (the ABI of the plugins
    is tied to the core library version). The input plugins are therefore
    shipped in the same package as the core library. This situation is subject
    to review with upstream, and may change; but for now, you will need to
    ensure that your data source registration uses the correct path for the
    version of the library you are using. You can use the mapnik-plugin-path
    utility included in the libmapnik-dev package to automatically determine
    the path at build time.
